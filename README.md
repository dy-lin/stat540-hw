## About Me
My name is Diana Lin. I'm a first-year graduate student at the University of British Columbia (UBC) in Vancouver, BC, starting my Master of Science in Bioinformatics. In 2018, I finished my Bachelor of Science in Physiology at McGill University. Following my graduation, I completed an 8-month internship at the [Bioinformatics Technology Lab (BTL)](http://www.birollab.ca), where I currently work, located in [Canada's Michael Smith Genome Sciences Centre](http://www.bcgsc.ca).

### About My Project
For my thesis, I am working on the development and execution of an antimicrobial peptide (AMP) discovery pipeline. This pipeline starts with transcriptome assembly and annotation, followed by homology search, secondary structure predictions, and relative solvent accesibility predictions. Given RNA-seq reads, the pipeline will be able to output a set of potential AMP sequences with a ranking score.

## Goals of this Course
From this course, I hope to achieve a set of statistics skills to analyze my data effectively and efficiently. I hope to learn metrics to assess the quality of my data.
