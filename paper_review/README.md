## About this Assignment

Criteria below taken directly from the [course website](https://stat540-ubc.github.io/subpages/assignments.html#paper-review):

Each student should review [this paper](paper.pdf) [[NCBI]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4405555/) in a 450-650 word summary/report. The summary should include: 

1. A brief review of the goal, findings and conclusion of the paper. 
2. A list (or mentioning) of the related datasets/databases and data types used in the study. In the case of datasets, provide some details of the data matrix and meta data.
3. A brief review of the analytical steps in the paper with more details on some selected parts which are relevant to the course materials. *You don't need to understand all of the analysis, but should be able to identify the key analysis/method used to answer the question the paper is intended to answer*
4. Some comments and critiques about the analytical steps, alternative suggestions or improvements. 

We have provided [**this guideline**](http://stat540-ubc.github.io/homework/paper\_critique/PRguideline_2019.html) for this task. The material in the review **should not** be limited to merely answering the questions in the guideline, but rather using them to provide the required items listed above. Example paper reviews are also provided. Here's [another helpful resource](https://github.com/jtleek/readingpapers) on how to read a research paper.

**Delivery:** You should put your paper review files in your individual course repository in .md format (notice that you don't need to write it in .Rmd since you are not going to have any R code in it). You could edit .md files directly from github and therefore can write your full report there, but can also write it in your RStudio and then push it to your repository.
