```

To demonstrate that I've understood the seminar material regarding markdown features, I've compiled a simple summary of dogs I know. Markdown features used include:

* Headers
* Lists
* Links
* Images

# Meet the Dogs

```{r load packages, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(ggrepel)
```

Read in the data:
```{r load csv}
dogs <- read_csv("dogs/dogs.csv", 
                 col_types = cols(col_character(),
                                  col_character(), 
                                  col_factor(),
                                  col_factor(),
                                  col_double()))
dogs$Size <- fct_relevel(dogs$Size, "small")

```
